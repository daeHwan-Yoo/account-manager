# Account Manager

Flexible C++ program manages customized bank accounts

## Summary
I developed a comprehensive bank account management program using C++ that allows users to create various account types and perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals. Our program calculates interest rates based on credit scores that the user sets, and I utilized C++ pointers and user-defined operators to enhance flexibility and optimize running time.
